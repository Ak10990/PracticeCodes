All Your Base
Say a new number system is developed with the letters ABC and it maps to base 10 numbering as follows

1: A
2: B
3: C
4: AA
5: AB
6: AC
7: BA
and so on

Write a program to find the representation in the new system given number N in base 10. In the previous example if N = 15, then the number would be: AAC

Input:

The first line of the input consists of a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of the string L and the integer N, separated by a space.

Output:

For each test case i numbered from 1 to T, output "Case #i: ", followed by the number.

Sample Input:

Sample Output:

Case #1: XDTXR
Case #2: JHEHCLYJEHSWSWSJYHE
Case #3: DEERLD
Case #4: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
